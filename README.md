# RestaurantPicker

My capstone project, [**Restaurant Picker**]() was to create a program to solve a problem. This is a simple program I made for a frequent problem my friends and I encounter.It takes my friends and I a while to choose any restaurant. To test my Python programming skills, I created a program that randomly chooses a restuarant based on a few criteria.

The user will be able to choose two things:
1. How much you want to spend: cheap, not bad, or expensive (this is all relevant to me and my own budget);
2. The type of cuisine (i.e. American, Mexican, Japanese, etc.) you want based on the list that's avaiable.

With these parameters the program randomly picks a resturant.
